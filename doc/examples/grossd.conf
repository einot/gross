# This is a sample configuration for grossd
#
# This file includes all valid configuration parameters, with their
# default values. All the default values are commented out, so any 
# all lines not commented out change the default settings.

# 'host' is the address the server should listen for queries
# DEFAULT: host = localhost

# 'port' is the port the server should listen for queries
# DEFAULT: port = 5525

# 'protocol' activates the server protocols grossd will support
# Valid protocols are 'sjsms', 'postfix' and 'milter'
protocol = sjsms
protocol = postfix

# 'stat_type' is the name of the requested statistic. There can be multiple
# 'stat_type' options in the configuration file (Using both none and full is
# undefined). Default is none. Valid options are currently:
# full: grossd sends all possible statistics
# none: no statistics at all
# status: basic statistics set
# since_startup: basic set since the startup 
# delay: processing delay statistics
# EXAMPLE: stat_type = status
# EXAMPLE: stat_type = delay

# 'stat_interval' is the number of seconds between status log entries
# DEFAULT: stat_interval = 3600

# 'filter_bits' is the size of the bloom filter. Size will be 2^filter_bits
# lowering this value will increase the probability of false matches
# in each individual bloom filter
# DEFAULT: filter_bits = 24

# 'number_buffers' is the number of filters used in the ring queue
# raising this value will cause an entry to stay in the servers' memory longer
# DEFAULT: number_buffers = 8

# 'rotate_interval' is the number of seconds between filter rotation.
# Let N := 'number_buffers' and I := 'rotate_interval'. An entry will
# stay in the servers' memory for (N - 0.5) * I seconds in average. 
# DEFAULT: rotate_interval = 3600

# 'sync_listen' is the address to listen for communication with the peer
# defaults to 'host' option
# sync_listen = 

# 'sync_peer' is the address of the peer used in clustered mode
# sync_peer = 

# 'sync_port' is the port number to listen to and connect to in 
# communication with the peer. 
# DEFAULT: sync_port = 5524

# 'status_host' is the address grossd listens for status queries
# DEFAULT: status_host = localhost

# 'status_port' is the port number grossd listens for status queries
# DEFAULT: status_port = 5522

# 'statefile' is the full path of the file that the server will use to
# store the state information. 
# statefile = /var/db/grossd.state

# 'pidfile' is the full path of the file grossd writes its pid into.
# You can set parameter 'check', if you want to keep grossd
# from starting if pidfile already exists.
# pidfile = /var/run/grossd.pid;check

# 'log_method' is used to list all the possible logging facilities.
# currently only syslog is implemented
# DEFAULT: log_method = syslog

# 'log_level' Possible log levels are 'debug', 'info', 'notice'
# 'warning' and 'error'.
# DEFAULT: log_level = info

# 'syslog_facility' is the facility syslog sends log messages with.
# DEFAULT: syslog_facility = mail

# 'update' is the way server updates the database. Valid options are
# 'grey' and 'always'. If 'update = grey' grossd will update the database
# only if response is STATUS_GREY 
# DEFAULT: update = grey

# 'grey_tuple' is the way greylisting tuples are created. Valid options are
# 'user' and 'server'. If 'grey_tuple = user' the tuple for grey listing
# will be: masked client-ip, sender email, recipient email. If 'grey_tuple =
# server' the tuple for greylisting will be client-ip, domain of sender email
# and helo.
# DEFAULT: grey_tuple = user

# 'grey_mask' is the mask for grossd to use when matching client_ip
# against the database. Default is 24, so grossd treats addresses
# like a.b.c.d as a.b.c.0. Setting this to 32 makes grossd to 
# require that consecutive attempts are made from the same ip address.
# DEFAULT: grey_mask = 24

# 'grey_delay' is the time in seconds new triplets are kept on the greylist.
# DEFAULT: grey_delay = 10

# 'query_timelimit' is the query timeout in milliseconds.
# DEFAULT: query_timelimit = 5000

# 'pool_maxthreads' is the maximum threadcount per pool. You may have
# to raise the limit from the default if you get more than 100 
# queries per second and/or have slow dns servers. Rule of thumb would be
# decide how many queries you want grossd to be able to handle per second,
# and multiply that with query_timelimit (in seconds, of course). 
# DEFAULT: pool_maxthreads = 100

# 'block_threshold' is the threshold after which grossd sends 
# a permanent error to the client. Every check that considers client_ip
# as suspicious returns a value (check weight). When sum of these
# values gets equivalent or greater than 'block_threshold', grossd
# sends a STATUS_BLOCK response. Default is 0, which disables
# this functionality.
# DEFAULT: block_threshold = 0

# 'block_reason' is the reason given when client is too suspicious,
# see block_threshold
# DEFAULT: block_reason = Bad reputation

# 'grey_threshold' is analogous to 'block_threshold', except at the 
# threshold grossd sends a STATUS_GREY response.
# DEFAULT: grey_threshold = 1

# 'check' lists all the checks grossd will do to judge if client_ip is
# suspicious or not. 
check = dnsbl
#check = rhsbl
#check = dnswl

# 'dnsbl' is a dns domain name of the dnsbl that 'dnsbl' check will query
# There are no defaults, but below is a list of dnsbls you could be using
# you may assign different weights for the dnsbl's, default weight is 1
# dnsbl = rbl-plus.mail-abuse.net # this is not free
dnsbl = bl.spamcop.net;2
dnsbl = combined.njabl.org
dnsbl = cbl.abuseat.org
dnsbl = dnsbl.sorbs.net

# 'rhsbl' is analogous to 'dnsbl'
#rhsbl = rhsbl.sorbs.net

# 'dnswl' is analogous to 'dnsbl'. Remember that dnswl is a *definitive*
# check, that is grossd waits for the check to complete before deciding
# how to respond. This may cause unwanted latency. Highly recommended if
# you use grossd as a traditional greylister.
#dnswl = query.bondedsender.org 

# 'blocker_host' is the host name of the Sophos blocker server.
# blocker_host =

# 'blocker_port' is the tcp port of the Sophos blocker service.
# DEFAULT: blocker_port = 4466

# 'blocker_weight' is the weight of the blocker check. (See description of 'dnsbl')
# DEFAULT: blocker_weight = 1

# 'milter_listen' is the socket for milter service.
# EXAMPLE: milter_listen = inet:5523@localhost
